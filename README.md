# C Raycast Shadows
This project utilizes code from my [C Raycasting repository](https://github.com/FuzzyCat444/C-Raycasting) as well as my [C Laser Physics repository](https://github.com/FuzzyCat444/C-Laser-Physics) to create a shadow effect using the [DDA raycasting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_differential_analyzer_(graphics_algorithm)).

## Compilation Instructions
To compile this application, create a folder called "project" or similar and place the src folder and build.bat into the folder. Install the SDL2-2.28.3 dev library for visual studio at "C:\SDL2-2.28.3" or wherever you want, updating the build.bat file to refer to the correct library directory. Copy the SDL.dll file from "C:\SDL2-2.28.3\lib\x64" into the "project" folder. Then open the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022" application, navigate to the "project" folder, and run the "build.bat" file.
